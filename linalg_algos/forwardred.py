Forward Reduction
    This is an algorithm to help with the process of forward reduction, during Gauss Elimination
    This is used to solve linear systems 

Algo: 
    Let m * n be a matrix
    1. Locate the first non-zero column from the left in M and call it column j. This is the pivot column
    2. Choose a non-zero entry in p_j in column j. We call p_j the pivot 
    3. Cover the pivot row to form a submatrix wiht one less row
